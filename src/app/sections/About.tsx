        I'm a frontend developer with an eye for design. I value clean code,
        creative solutions, and building things that make a difference. I thrive
        in the sweet spot between technical precision and intuitive
        interfacesâ€”crafting experiences for Azerbaijan's financial sector by
        day, and experimenting with new technologies by night. This site
        showcases my journey, projects, and the occasional breakthrough moment.
